**Prediction markets model**

The simulations are conducted in Python. To run the code:

(1) Install the required modules (see lines 3-6)

(2) Set the number of desired simulations $s$ (in the paper, $s = 10,000$).

(3) Set the market parameters: $w$, $y$, $n$, size, final_time, man_time, and $l$ (these parameters are pre-set to the baseline case).
